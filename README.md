# Simple Shell

Simple Shell is a basic UNIX command-line interpreter that can execute commands and their arguments. It was built as part of the requirements for the Holberton School System Programming curriculum.

## Functionality

Simple Shell allows users to enter commands with their arguments just as they would with a standard UNIX shell. It includes basic features such as running commands with their arguments and exiting the shell with the `exit` command or by pressing `Ctrl + D`.

## Features

- Run commands with their arguments
- Exit shell with `exit` command or by pressing `Ctrl + D`

## Getting Started

To use Simple Shell, clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/Mario-Mellek/simple_shell.git`
Compile the source code using the following command:
`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`

To run the Simple Shell, execute the `shell` file created by the compilation command: `./shell`

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands with their arguments just as you would with a standard UNIX shell.
